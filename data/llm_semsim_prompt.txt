You will now be provided with two sentences. Judge the semantic similarity between them as a number between 0 and 1. Assign a low number if the sentences are contradictory. Assign about 0.2 if they are unrelated. Assign a number close to 1 if they are in close agreement. Assign a low score if one sentence is a question, while the other sentence is not.

First sentences: <SEQUENCE_1>
Second sentence: <SEQUENCE_2>

Now provide your answer as a single float, with no additional commentary.
